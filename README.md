# dotfiles

Inspired by [this blog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) (Atlassian did good for once).

Zsh config has been rewritten to use [Antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/install/) using static loading of plugins. Plugins are stored in `.zsh_plugins.txt` and can be bundled by running `antibody bundle < ~/.zsh_plugins.txt > ~/.zsh_plugins.sh` and then `source ~/.zshrc` to reload. The only issue currently is getting Oh My Zsh plugins to work, so I've left them out.

This config uses [Spaceship prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt), which requires a powerline font. I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

The intention is for all Mac setup to be generated by the Ansible playbook in .ansible, which will include Homebrew-managed packages  (as well as cask applications). This is currently very unfinished, but the brew packages currently installed can all be found in .ansible/roles/setup/vars/main.yml.

## TODO:
- Get Anisble set up and working
- Include all key applications as Homebrew-managed cask installs
- Write and add sensible .vimrc
- Possibly move zsh plugins to be Ansible-managed
- Include terminal font in Ansible
- Include configs for:
  - iTerm
  - VSCode
  - IntelliJ
  - AWS, Serverless
  - yarn, npm, maven, gradle
  - Karabiner
  - MacOS
